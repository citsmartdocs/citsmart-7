This knowledge aims to guide and suggest the best ways to conduct searches within the Knowledge Portal and the User Guide.

Search tips
-------------------

1. Search with exclusions:

    - it is possible to refine (reduce) the result by including words to be taken from the resulting list, example:
        - search for the word **request**;
        - it will show more than 210 items;
        - add after the word used the expression **-incident**;
        - less than 105 knowledge will appear;
        - any word preceded by a negative sign "-" means to the system that it is undesirable in the search result;
        - and you can avoid more than one word at the same time: **request -incident -problem -event**
        - it was reduced to 85.
        
2. Varying how to spell the word, example:

    - Request
    - Requests
    - Required
    - it is possible to search only a *part* of the word: **Requ**
    
3. Search for an exact phrase:

    - just put the desired phrase in double quotation marks, example 1:
        - search for "request suspension" ;
        - will appear **5** results;
        - if you do the same search without any quotes, will appear more than **210**. In this case the system has searched for any 
        knowledge that has at least one of the words.
        
    - example 2:
        - search for "itsm"
        - it will show more than 170 items;
        - if you do the same search without any quotes, will appear more than 320. The system has searched for any knowledge that 
        has ITSM as a entire word and also as part of some words, eg. C**ITSM**ART.
        
4. Search by prioritizing a word:

    - it is possible to perform a search with more than one word prioritizing one of them in the result. Add the plus sign "+" in 
    front of the word that will be prioritized, eg.:
        - requiriment +ticket;
        - +requiriment ticket.
        
5. Browse *folders* and click on the desired subject folder:

    - the product documentation is structured into folders, it reminds the system menu;
    - this way you will avoid seeing other subjects in the result;
    - the search brings all that is in the folder clicked and also in all its subfolders, they are the subtopics;
    - to select a folder on guides located on the tabs on the top left by the icon ![symbol](images/tips.jpg), it is possible to 
    realize a new one searching in this folder. After this new search the system will show on left side the fields:
        - **Selected Folder**: describes the name of the previously selected folder. It is possible to return to the root of the 
        folder by clicking on the folder description, in which case the system will return to the initial search behavior;
        - **Type**: refers to the type of document identified in this folder, the folder can contain various types of documents. 
        Having more than one type of document the system allows searching by types.
