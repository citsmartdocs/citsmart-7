2.  Fill in the fields as directed below:

    -  **Name**: enter the name of the business process;

    -  **Customer**: inform the client of the business process;

    -  **Responsible group**: inform the group responsible for the business
        process;

    -  **Administrator group**: inform the business process administrator
        group;

    -  **Flows**: select the workflow (s) of the business process. Remembering
        that these flows are defined in the flow designing screen;

    -  **Important function**: inform if the business process is referring to a
        vital function. Vital function is a part of a business process that is
        critical to business success, ie it is the part of running the business
        that can not stop. Imagine, for example, software that takes care of the
        process of an automatic teller machine for cash withdrawals: the
        function of issuing banknotes for the customer will probably have a
        greater criticality than the function of issuing extracts. Therefore,
        the former is more likely to be considered a vital function. Vital role
        is an important consideration in managing service continuity;

        impact and urgency.

    (s) to the business process;

-   To delete the link from the drive to the business process, simply click
    the ![figure](images/business-4.png) .

3.  After entering the data, click the *Save* button to register, where the
    date, time and user will be saved automatically for a future audit.
