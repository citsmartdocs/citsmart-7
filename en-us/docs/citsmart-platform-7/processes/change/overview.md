Module objective

Change Management is the process responsible for evaluating, coordinating, and deciding on making proposed changes to Configuration 
Items (CIs).

prioritized, planned, tested, deployed and documented.

Changes can be categorized as follows: Standard Change, Normal Change, and Emergency Change.

- **Standard Change**: pre-authorized low-risk, occurs frequently. It is initiated by a defined trigger that follows a procedure or work instruction to carry out the activities - well known - have a pre-determined budget. Eg: Install a standard desktop application package.

- **Normal Change**: any service change other than emergency or standard. It follows the policies, deadlines and procedures defined 
by the organization.

- **Emergency Change**: change that needs to be accomplished as soon as possible. Eg: Change to resolve a Serious Incident or 
implement a security fix. The Change Management process usually has a specific procedure to handle emergency changes.
