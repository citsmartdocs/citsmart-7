![symbol](images/simb-cits.jpg) CITSmart Enterprise ITSM
------------------------------------------------------------

It is an intelligent corporate governance platform in line with an Information Technology Service Management (ITSM), whose overall 
objective is to support organizations in Information Technology (IT) and Business Service Management by adopting the best practices 
ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library).

**Why Adopt It**? It is known that working with real-time information in decision making makes companies more competitive and 
qualified to meet their demands and their activities in order to reduce losses or business damages since they are in constant 
monitoring. Therefore, if well applied, information technology makes managers better understand their business activities and 
employ the energetic flows of investments in the most appropriate direction. This provides companies with an organizational 
structure and a service implementation that applies the best practices to the organizational environment, translating objectives 
and goals into measurable reality.

The image below shows the significant coverage of this solution in relation to the processes foreseen in the ITIL library:IL:
