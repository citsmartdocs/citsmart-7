    - **Title**: short text that easily identifies the purpose of the questionnaire;
    - **Category**: list of pre-registered categories that help manage Questionnaire 
    sets;
    - **Group**: a Questionnaire organizes its items in a way grouped by some 
    subjective criterion of the consultant or client, there may be more than one group 
    in the questionnaire (as if they were several subjects);
        - **Group Title**: just in front of the word "Group" you can edit and change 
    the expression "without title 1" by a significant title to describe the 
    purpose/criterion of the grouping;
        - A group can have one or more questions, each composed of:
            - **Question**: title of the Question so that it is possible for the 
    reader to understand what he should answer;
            - **Type**: there are several types of questions, each one will cause 
    different behavior when the Questionnaire is executed;
            - **Required**: indicates whether or not the question can be accepted 
    without being completed;
            
2. The *Add Question* button allows you to enter one more question right after the 
last one;

3. The *Add Text* button allows you to edit a content in a text box so that guidelines 
can be shown in the Questionnaire when it is run;

4. The *Add a Group* button adds another Group just after the last to be filled ;

5. The *Export* button allows you to record on a disk an electronic file containing 
all the characteristics of the selected Questionnaire.
