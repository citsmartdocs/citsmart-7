# How to navegate the screens using the CITSmart Enterprise ITSM controls?

The purpose of this document is to clarify some rules of navigability and usability that will be valid for the vast majority of the 
screens (functionalities) of this solution. These rules apply to the ITIL processes that this solution is Pink Verify certified in 
Pink Elephant, which are:

1. Portfolio Management (SPM)

2. Service Catalog Management (SCM)

3. Service Level Management (SLM)

4. Change Management (CHG)

5. Release and Deployment Management (REL)

6. Knowledge Management (KM)

7. Service Asset & Configuration Management (SACM)

8. Event Management (EV)

9. Request fulfillment (RF)

10. Incident Management (IM)

11. Problem Management (PM)

12. Continuity Management (ITSCM)

13. Availability Management (AVM)

Combining all these rules inside only onde introducing document avoids redundancy of many basic texts that once understood, do not 
add value diluted in all knowledge base documents.

Field filling requirement
--------------------------------------

On all screens there may be one or more required fields. To facilitate their visual identification, this solution adopts a red 
asterisk close to the field label.

Recording/deleting the record, or even the execution of the corresponding task to the screen, will not occur until at least one of 
these fields is empty (unfilled).

**Figure 1 - Example of field marked with asterisk**

Capacity to search with close lookup
--------------------------------------

In all the features with the "Search" tab there is a common search behavior, it does not require that the word be typed exactly, it 
can be part of the word, for example, when typing the word "lack of" the search may return these titles of Problems Category: "lack 
of toner ", "lack of disk space", e.g.
