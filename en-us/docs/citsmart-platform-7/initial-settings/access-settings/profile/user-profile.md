!!! info "IMPORTANT"

     The exclusions executed in the product are logical (and not physical), so
     in extreme cases there is how to recover something excluded, but this will
     require technical support from an analyst/consultant.

!!! note "NOTE"

     When determining the type of access profile, by marking/unmarking a
     checkbox, all checkboxes that are subordinate to it in the structure are
     also marked/unmarked cascade.

!!! note "NOTE"

     The access profiles will be disabled (the checkboxes of all pre-existing
     access profiles will be unchecked), by default, when new features are
     created, thus requiring the administrator to explicitly enable this for the
     profiles you want, making it available for the desired profiles.

   -   **Can the user access the system**: determine if the profile will be able to
    access the system through the portal;

3. After inserting the data, click on the  button to confirm the entry, where
    the date, time and user will be stored for a future audit.
