# Group-employee relationship rules

1. In a group it can contain several collaborators, and they can be part of one or more group. Each group has an access profile, and the employees assigned to the group share the same access profile.

2. When you perform the action of removing a collaborator from a group, the system checks if there are requests with status "In progress" where the "current group" and "responsible" correspond to the "group" and the "collaborator". If there is, the employee will not be removed from the group.
