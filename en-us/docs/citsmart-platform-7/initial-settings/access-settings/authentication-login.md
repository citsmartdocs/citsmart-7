I forgot my password
--------------------

This is an important option because it is not uncommon we forget our password,
because there are many in many applications.

Preconditions

    configuration registration and search][3])

2.  The keywords you enter to enter the e-mail template are:

    -   \${NOMEEMPREGADO} - Returns the name of the user who requested the
        password reset;

    -   \${LOGIN} - User login that requested password reset;

    -   \${NOVASENHA} - New password generated by the system.

3.  The parameter must be configured: 116 - E-mail template ID to change the
    access password to CITSmart

How to restore the password
---------------------------

1.  Access the CITSmart login screen;

2.  Click on the link I forgot my password;

3.  Inform the e-mail where the new password will be sent;

4.  After these steps, the system assigns new provisional content to the user's
    password and sends it by e-mail according to the registered e-mail template.

!!! warning "ATTENTION"

    If the integration of CITSmart is with LDAP, it will not be possible to
    assign contents to the user's password. In this case, the user must be sent
    the means to request the password reset.
